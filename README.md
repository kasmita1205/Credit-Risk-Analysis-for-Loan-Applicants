# Credit-Risk-Analysis-for-Loan-Applicants
## üìç Background
Financial institutions face critical decisions when processing loan applications:
- **Approving creditworthy applicants** ‚Üí Drives business growth  
- **Approving risky applicants** ‚Üí Leads to financial losses  

This project analyzes historical LendingClub loan data containing outcomes for approved applicants:
| Loan Status       | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Fully Paid     | Loan repaid successfully                                                   |
| ‚è≥ Current        | Active loans (excluded from analysis)                                       |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Charged-off   | Defaulted loans (target risk event)                                        |

> Note: Rejected applications aren't included as they have no repayment history.

## üéØ Objective
Develop predictive models to:
1. **Reduce credit loss** by identifying high-risk applicants  
2. **Optimize approval rates** for creditworthy borrowers  
3. **Inform risk-based pricing strategies**  
4. **Discover key default drivers** in lending portfolios  

## üìÇ Dataset
**Source**: [Lending Club Loan Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club)  
**Scope**: 2007-2018 approved loans filtered to 2017-2018 (~225K records)  
**Key Features**:
- Borrower characteristics (FICO, income, employment)  
- Loan details (amount, term, purpose, grade)  
- Financial metrics (DTI, installment payments)  
- Historical data (credit history length)

## üîÑ Pipeline Overview

1. **Ingest & Trim**  
   * Load LendingClub‚Äôs full 2007-2018 file (2.2 M rows) and keep/rename the 15 core borrower & loan fields we actually need.  
   * Flag `dti` outliers (< 0 or > 100) and replace with the median

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   * Defaults make up **‚âà 21 %** of the sample ‚Äì a solid but manageable class imbalance.  
   * Typical borrower: \$14 k loan, 13.8 % APR, FICO ‚âà 702, DTI ‚âà 18 %.  
   * Strongest simple correlations with default are **interest rate**, **low FICO**, and **longer term** (confirmed later by feature importance).

3. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  
   * Median-impute numeric nulls; convert `emp_length`, `term`, `grade`, `purpose` etc. to one-hot dummies.  
   * Derive **`credit_age`** (years since earliest credit line) , **default** (charged-off -> 1 else 0) 

4. **Train-Test Split**  
   * 80 / 20 stratified on the target, newest vintages reserved for testing to mimic real-world deployment drift.

5. **Modeling & Evaluation**  
   * Baseline **Logistic Regression** 
   * **Random Forest** (300 trees, depth 5) for a quick nonlinear benchmark.  
   * **XGBoost** tuned on 400 trees with `scale_pos_weight` to handle imbalance.
  
## üìä Key EDA Findings
‚Ä¢ Highest risk Grade: G (50.1% default rate)

‚Ä¢ Highest risk Home Ownership: RENT (26.4% default rate)

‚Ä¢ Highest risk Verification Status: Verified (28.2% default rate)

‚Ä¢ Highest risk Purpose: wedding (50.0% default rate)

‚Ä¢ Fico Low Range < 700 == High Risk

‚Ä¢ Revolving Utilization Rate > 38% == High Risk

‚Ä¢ Debt to Income Ratio > 20 == High Risk

  
 ## üèÅ Model Results

| Model | ROC-AUC | Accuracy | Recall (Defaulters) | Notes |
|-------|--------:|---------:|--------------------:|-------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.688 | **0.79** |0.07 | High accuracy but poor at catching defaulters |
| XGBoost (400 √ó depth 4) | **0.72** | 0.64 | 0.69 | Strongest AUC thanks to clean linear features |
| Random Forest (300 √ó depth 5) | 0.699 | 0.60 | **0.71** |  Better minority-class recall, lower overall accuracy |
